# CTTS Configuration File
# Concatenative Text-to-Speech Engine Settings

# Audio concatenation settings
audio:
  # Crossfade duration between syllables within a word (milliseconds)
  # Higher values = smoother transitions, but may blur consonants
  # Recommended: 70-100ms for very tight blending
  crossfade_ms: 90

  # Crossfade duration when previous syllable ends with a vowel (milliseconds)
  # Vowel endings blend naturally, so longer crossfade sounds smoother
  # Recommended: 100-150ms for very natural flow
  crossfade_vowel_ms: 140

  # Crossfade duration when previous syllable ends with 'S' (milliseconds)
  # S-endings need crisper transitions to sound natural
  # Recommended: 25-40ms for clear S sounds
  crossfade_s_ending_ms: 30

  # Crossfade duration when previous syllable ends with 'R' (milliseconds)
  # R-endings need crisper transitions to sound natural
  # Recommended: 25-40ms for clear R sounds
  crossfade_r_ending_ms: 30

  # Crossfade reduction factor when vowel transitions to consonant (0.0-1.0)
  # Vowel-to-consonant transitions are crisp, so shorter crossfade is better
  # 0.9 means 90% of normal crossfade duration (minimal reduction = very smooth)
  vowel_to_consonant_factor: 0.9

  # Remove silence within words (silence only allowed between words)
  # This detects and removes low-amplitude regions within words
  remove_word_silence: true

  # Silence detection threshold (0.0-1.0, relative to max amplitude)
  # Regions below this threshold are considered silence
  # Higher = less aggressive (keeps more quiet sounds)
  silence_threshold: 0.04

  # Minimum silence duration to detect (milliseconds)
  # Shorter silences are ignored - higher value = less cutting
  min_silence_ms: 35

  # Silence duration between words (milliseconds)
  # This is pure silence, no crossfade
  # Recommended: 80-150ms for natural speech
  word_pause_ms: 60

  # Silence duration for unknown/missing characters (milliseconds)
  unknown_silence_ms: 30

  # Fade-in duration at the start of each unit (milliseconds)
  # Helps avoid click artifacts
  fade_in_ms: 3

  # Fade-out duration at the end of each unit (milliseconds)
  # Helps avoid click artifacts
  fade_out_ms: 3

# Signal processing
processing:
  # Remove DC offset from audio samples
  remove_dc_offset: true

  # Normalize audio levels (0.0 = disabled, 0.1-1.0 = target peak level)
  # 0.8 means normalize to 80% of max amplitude
  normalize_level: 0.0

  # Apply gentle compression to even out volume
  # 0.0 = disabled, 1.0 = maximum compression
  compression: 0.0

# Synthesis settings
synthesis:
  # Default speech speed (0.5 = half speed, 2.0 = double speed)
  default_speed: 1.2

  # Minimum speed allowed
  min_speed: 0.5

  # Maximum speed allowed
  max_speed: 2.0

# Debug settings
debug:
  # Print matched units during synthesis
  print_units: false

  # Print timing information
  print_timing: false
